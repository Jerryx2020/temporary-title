#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)

#### Simulate data ####
set.seed(304)

# Define the start and end date for inspection simulation
start_date <- as.Date("2018-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2023-12-31")

# Set the number of records you want to simulate
number_of_records <- 100

# Simulating establishment types (e.g., restaurant, food truck, etc.)
establishment_types <- c("Restaurant", "CafÃ©", "Food Truck", "Bakery", "Bar")

# Simulating inspection outcomes (e.g., Pass, Conditional Pass, Closed)
outcomes <- c("Pass", "Conditional Pass", "Closed")

# Simulating infraction severity levels (e.g., S - Significant, M - Minor, C - Crucial)
severity_levels <- c("S", "M", "C")

# Simulating the DineSafe data
simulated_data <- 
  tibble(
    establishment_name = paste("Establishment", 1:number_of_records),
    establishment_type = sample(establishment_types, number_of_records, replace = TRUE),

        n = number_of_records,

    outcome = sample(outcomes, number_of_records, replace = TRUE),
    amount_fined = rpois(number_of_records, lambda = 100) * 10 # Simulating fines with a Poisson distribution
  )

#### Write to CSV ####
