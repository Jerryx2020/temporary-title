# Inspection Frequency Reveals Violation Patterns in Toronto Restaurants and Takeout Establishments (2022-2024)

## Description

This GitHub Repository contains all the files used to generate the paper *Inspection Frequency Reveals Violation Patterns in Toronto Restaurants and Takeout Establishments (2022-2024)*.

The DineSafe dataset from Torontoâ€™s Open Data platform was analyzed to investigate the relationship between inspection frequency and the prevalence of infractions in various food service establishments, such as restaurants and takeout locations. Some of the R code used in this analysis was adapted from publicly available resources and tools from the R community.

## File Structure

The structure of this Repository is as follows:

- `data/raw_data` includes the raw DineSafe dataset used in the analysis.
- `data/analysis_data` includes the cleaned dataset used in the analysis after processing and filtering.
- `other/llm` includes a `usage.txt` file providing information on language models used.
- `other/sketches` contains images representing the dataset and visualizations used in the report.
- `paper` includes the final paper (`paper.pdf`), the Quarto file (`paper.qmd`) used to create the PDF, and the references (`references.bib`).
- `scripts` contains R scripts for different stages of the analysis

## LLM Usage Statement

This project utilized ChatGPT for assistance with code suggestions, explanations, and refining data visualizations. Comments detailing the specific instances where language models were used have been included directly in the relevant code scripts, and a complete overview of the LLM usage is provided in `usage.txt` located in `other/llm`.

This project was completed primarily using R for data analysis, processing, and visualization. All necessary scripts, data, and references are included in the Repository to ensure reproducibility.
